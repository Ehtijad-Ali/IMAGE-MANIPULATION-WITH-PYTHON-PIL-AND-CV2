# Image Manipulation using Python Libraries: PIL and OpenCV
## Objective
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate basic image manipulation techniques using Python libraries PIL (Pillow) and OpenCV (cv2). These libraries offer robust tools for handling images and performing tasks such as color adjustments, channel extraction, and format conversions.

## Description
This project provides an introduction to image processing using two popular Python libraries:

### PIL (Pillow):
A powerful library that makes it easy to load, manipulate, and save images. With PIL, we can perform a variety of operations, such as:
Opening and displaying images.
Converting images between different color modes.
Manipulating individual color channels for effects, such as adding yellow or removing blue tones.
### OpenCV (cv2): 
A versatile library commonly used for computer vision tasks. OpenCV enables:
Loading images in various formats.
Converting images between BGR and RGB formats.
Accessing and modifying individual color channels.
Visualizing images using matplotlib for easy comparison and analysis.
## Key Features Demonstrated:
Loading and Saving Images: We cover how to load images from files and save manipulated images.
Color Channel Manipulation: We demonstrate techniques for isolating and modifying specific color channels.
Color Space Conversion: We show how to convert images between different color spaces (e.g., BGR to RGB).
Image Visualization: We use matplotlib to display images and view changes in real-time.

## Conclusion
By utilizing both PIL and OpenCV, we can take advantage of each libraryâ€™s unique features and strengths. PIL excels at straightforward image manipulations, while OpenCV provides robust support for complex computer vision tasks. Together, these libraries allow for flexible and powerful image processing workflows. Whether you're modifying color channels, converting formats, or preparing images for advanced analysis, PIL and OpenCV provide essential tools for your image processing projects.
